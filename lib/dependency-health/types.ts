// External Dependency Health — shared types.
//
// AO-side only: we can't change RoboHire or the LLM vendor. We read what they
// return us (status / error body / response content) and judge, on our side,
// whether a paid dependency is dead — and if so, whether it's 没钱了 (out of
// funds), 故障了 (a fault/outage), or 说不准 (we genuinely can't tell).
//
// See docs/superpowers/specs/2026-06-05-external-dependency-health-design.md.

 * The machine-readable cause, derived from the vendor's response. This is the
 * raw classification of ONE call; the 没钱/故障/说不准 *judgment* is made later
 * by the monitor over a window of these (see DepLabel).
 *   quota      — out of funds / quota exhausted (the cleanest money signal)
 *   auth       — 401/403 (expired-or-revoked key? misconfig? genuinely ambiguous)
 *   rate_limit — 429 throttle
 *   empty      — 200 OK but the payload has nothing usable (silent degrade)
 *   server     — 5xx
 *   network    — unreachable / timeout / connection reset
